### Negotiation Strategy for Contract Renewal with AluminiumY

#### Summary of Market Situation and Stock Value Analysis
The current stock value of Aluminium has shown some fluctuations over the past year, with the latest value being approximately $2352.47 per metric ton. The market news sentiment for the most relevant companies (Alcoa, Century Aluminum, and Kaiser Aluminum) is generally neutral to somewhat bullish, indicating a stable to slightly positive market outlook for Aluminium.

#### Strategy
Given the criticality of the supplier (Tier 1 - Business Critical) and the high risk associated with the contract, the negotiation strategy should focus on securing favorable terms while mitigating risks. Here are the key points to consider:

1. **Price Increase**: The supplier has requested a 10% price increase. Given the current market stability and the slight bullish sentiment, negotiate to cap the price increase at no more than 8%. Emphasize the stable market conditions and the recent stock value trends to support your position.

2. **Contract Term**: Aim to extend the contract term to 3 years. This will provide price stability and reduce the frequency of renegotiations. Highlight the benefits of a long-term partnership and the potential for mutual growth.

3. **Price Protection Clause**: The current clause is partial/capped, which poses a medium risk. Negotiate for a more favorable clause, ideally a full price protection clause to safeguard aThe current stock value of Aluminium has shown some fluctuations over the past year, with the latest value being approximately $2352.47 per metric ton.

Negotiate for a more favorable clause, ideally a full price protection clause to safeguard against unexpected price hikes.

4. **Possible Transition Costs**: The transition costs to alternative suppliers are high ($500,000). Use this as leverage to negotiate better terms with the current supplier, emphasizing the cost and disruption associated with switching suppliers.

5. **Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)**: The TCO without change is $1,650,000, while with change it is $1,700,000. Highlight the cost efficiency of staying with the current supplier and negotiate to keep the TCO as low as possible.

6. **Number of Alternative Suppliers**: There are 2 alternative suppliers available. Use this information to create competitive pressure, but also acknowledge the high transition costs to strengthen your negotiation position with AluminiumY.

7. **Risk Level**: The risk level is very high. Stress the importance of a reliable supply chain and the critical role AluminiumY plays in your operations. This can help in negotiating better terms by emphasizing the mutual dependency.

8. **Spend**: The current spend is $15,000,000. Use this significant spend as a bargaining chip to negotiate volume discounts or other favorable terms.

By focusing on these key dimensions and leveraging the current market conditions, you can negotiate a renewal contract that minimizes costs and risks while ensuring a stable and reliable supply of Aluminium.
